This blog will be about the treatment of books in several senses, though
none of them quite as Myles na gCopaleen proposed. Partly it will
document my own learning around certain digital humanities projects I am
involved in, mainly to do with the steep learning curve that presents
itself in coming to grips with XML, XSLT, and digital publishing in
general.Â  But it will also be about physical books, reading, teaching
and the acquisitive nature that leads to having more books than I ever
get around to reading. Perhaps some thoughts on the teaching and other
work I will be doing this coming semester may appear, who knows? Given
the very hazy plans at this stage, I think it's best that Myles has the
last word:

> DOG EARS FOUR-A-PENNY
> Let me explain exactly what I mean. The wares in a bookshop look
completely unread. On the other hand, a school-boy's Latin dictionary
looks read to the point of tatters. You know that the dictionary has
been opened and scanned perhaps a million times, and if you did not know
that there was such a thing as a box on the ear, you would conclude that
the boy is crazy about Latin and cannot bear to be away from his
dictionary. Similarly with our non-brow who wants his friends to infer
from a glancing around his house that he is a high-brow. He buys an
enormous book on the Russian ballet, written possibly in the language of
that distant but beautiful land. Our problem is to alter the book in a
reasonably short time so that anybody looking at it will conclude that
its owner has practically lived, supped and slept with it for many
months. You can, if you like, talk about designing a machine driven by a
small but efficient petrol motor that would 'read' any book in five
minutes, the equivalent of five years or ten years' 'reading' being
obtained by merely turning a knob. This, how-ever, is the cheap soulless
approach of the times we live in. No machine can do the same work as the
soft human fingers. The trained and ex-perienced book-handler is the
only real solution of this contemporary social problem. What does he do?
How does he work? What would he charge? How many types of handling would
there be?

> These questions and many - I will answer the day after tomorrow.
