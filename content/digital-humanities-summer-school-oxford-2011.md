After silence for over four months(!), I'm going to pull my socks up and
get some decent content on this blog.  Next week is the [Digital
Humanities Summer School] [1] at Wolfson College, Oxford, and I'll be
reporting on the sessions I attend for each of the five days.
Unfortunately, because there are two parallel streams, I can only
attend half of all the sessions on offer, but it is going to be a busy
and fascinating week and one I've been looking forward to for a long
time.

The sessions I've chosen to attend focus on XML, XSLT, digital libraries
and project management.  On Monday, I'll be attending:
  
- Creating digital texts in XML using the TEI (Part 1)  
- “...and now what?” Some approaches to project modelling.  
- Practical RDF modelling and conversion  
- Providing documents on the web: experience from legislation.gov.uk
