In 2014 I am...

- Teaching *Wuthering Heights* and *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* as part of ENGL102: Great Works.

- Co-teaching a new course with [James Smithies](http://jamessmithies.org/), called ENGL345: Digital Literary Studies.  It will be an introduction to the digital humanities approaches to literary studies, and will include both new media and humanities computing perspectives.
