Title: Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:  

- [CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive] [1]  
This ongoing project is a big part of my day job, and has been since I returned to the University of Canterbury in 2012.  CEISMIC is slowly accumulating a rich store of materials about Christchurch before and after the 2010/2011 earthquakes, and is helping make it available for public use and research.  

- Kōmako: a bibliography of writing by Māori in English  
Kōmako is a project to digitise Dr. Bridget Underhill's 1998 annotated bibliography of Māori writing in English, and build a website that enables people to browse and search the entries.
