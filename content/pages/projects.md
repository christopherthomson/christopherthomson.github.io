Title: Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:  

- [CEISMIC Canterbury Earthquakes Digital Archive] [1]  
This ongoing project is a big part of my day job, and has been since I returned to the University of Canterbury in 2012.  CEISMIC is slowly accumulating a rich store of materials about Christchurch before and after the 2010/2011 earthquakes, and helping make as much of it available online as possible.  

- Kōmako: a bibliography of writing by Māori in English  
Kōmako is a digitisation project aiming to present Dr. Bridget Underhill's 1998 bibliography online in a form that can be searched and updated.
