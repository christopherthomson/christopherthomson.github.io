Slug: quotes-curly-and-otherwise

Part 2 of my bibliographic data transformation is proving quite
interesting. I've started work on constructing the TEI biblStruct
elements I'll need, and now my half-serious aim of using only XQuery
throughout the process is looking a more than a little naive. XSLT
breezes through some types of problems that had me stumped for long
periods trying to achieve the same result in XQuery. Anyway, the post on
that topic is still to come.

However, having realised late in the game that I need to replace all my
curly quotes with straight quotes, and having seen most discussion on
the topic suggest this would be difficult using XSLT, I was stoked to
find [this little gem] [1] for OS X users.

Find/Replace. Done.
