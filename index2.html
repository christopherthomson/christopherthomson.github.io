            </h2>
            <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d hoped to digest the summer school in a blog-as-you-go manner, but
each day was packed full of so much fantastic <span class="caps">DH</span> fare that I quickly
gave up on that plan.  But here&#8217;s my somewhat more considered review of
the first day, looking at most of the sessions I attended but
particularly the ones that are relevant to work I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>I went to four sessions on&nbsp;Monday:</p>
<p>(1) Creating digital texts using the <span class="caps">TEI</span> (part&nbsp;1)</p>
<p>The first session was something of a gallop through some <span class="caps">TEI</span> basics,
with Sebastian covering the initial material on what a <span class="caps">TEI</span> document
looks like, how to achieve well-formedness and validation, before moving
quickly on to more complex&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a fairly brief practical session to familiarise
ourselves with oXygen and some markup basics, we returned to hear
James&#8217;s talk on schema customisation using Roma.  He alternated between
a walkthrough of Roma and explaining the <span class="caps">ODD</span> (One Document Does it All)
<span class="caps">XML</span> that actually defines the custom schema.  I haven&#8217;t used <span class="caps">ODD</span> much
and would actually like to work on building a schema at the nuts and
bolts level, though I expect using Roma to get started would be the most
effective way to&nbsp;learn.</p>
<p>(2) &#8221;&#8230;and now what?&#8221;: Some approaches to project&nbsp;modelling</p>
<p>This presentation was delivered by Pip Willcox of the Bodleian Library,
and looked at some general principles of digital project management as
well as some fascinating details of some of the major projects she has
worked on.  The Shakespeare Quartos Archive was particularly interesting
because it involved international collaboration by (I think) six major
libraries and its fairly ambitious goals were achieved within a&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>Her main advice for <span class="caps">DH</span> projects was around communication and clear
documentation of each project, and with the kind of funding and
collaborative model that is the norm in <span class="caps">DH</span>, this was a very relevant&nbsp;message.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="caps">RDF</span> Modelling and&nbsp;Conversion</p>
<p>This session was somewhat outside of my experience, having only a vague
idea of what <span class="caps">RDF</span> does and never having used it.  Hmm.  Must look into
this some&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>(4) Plenary: Providing documents on the web: experience from&nbsp;legislation.gov.uk</p>
<p>Jeni Tennison is a well known <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">XSLT</span> expert, and she has clearly
tackled a major project as the architect of legislation.gov.uk.  The
website provides highly detailed, versioned records of <span class="caps">UK</span> legislation,
so provides not only the original form of any given piece of
legislation, it&#8217;s current form, but also every step in between.  Their
data comes in a variety of forms and can involve difficult substitutions
where changes cross or overlap document structures, or where changes are
made to a law that apply differently in England and&nbsp;Scotland.</p>
<p>Of interest to me is that they&#8217;re using a native <span class="caps">XML</span> database to handle
the data (I don&#8217;t think she mentioned which one).  This has proved more
flexible than a <span class="caps">SQL</span> database and is easily&nbsp;extensible.</p>
<p>They have also worked on user and re-user experience a lot, and are
moving to a participation phase where they get some major users to
contribute to the updating of the website.  There is an increasing
backlog of updates to the website, so they Since this is an open
project, those who would otherwise pay private legal services firms for
this information are motivated to help make it&nbsp;work.</p></div>

get some decent content on this blog.  Next week is the <a href="http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/DHSS2011/" title="Digital Humanities Summer School">Digital
Humanities Summer School</a> at Wolfson College, Oxford, and I&#8217;ll be
reporting on the sessions I attend for each of the five days.
Unfortunately, because there are two parallel streams, I can only
attend half of all the sessions on offer, but it is going to be a busy
and fascinating week and one I&#8217;ve been looking forward to for a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The sessions I&#8217;ve chosen to attend focus on <span class="caps">XML</span>, <span class="caps">XSLT</span>, digital libraries
and project management.  On Monday, I&#8217;ll be&nbsp;attending:</p>

            </h2>
            <div class="entry-content"><p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> (2/6/14): The right way to do this is to ignore this post and go get <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" title="virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.</p>
<p>Having spent a frustrating couple of hours on trying to set up the
Python <span class="caps">IDLE</span> and nltk module so I can teach myself some text mining
basics, I thought it would be worth noting the problems I had and how I
solved them.  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nltk-users/browse_thread/thread/e14b647243ca5b66" title="this thread">This thread</a> charts similar problems to mine, but I
resolved mine in a different way to the suggestions given. Basically,
the issue stems from installing a new version of Python alongside the
one that came with your&nbsp;Mac.</p>
<p>Instructions for setting up <a href="http://www.nltk.org/download">nltk</a> can be found at. Macs ship with Python installed, but the
<span class="caps">IDLE</span> app either does not come with <span class="caps">OSX</span> or is not enabled.  nltk.org
recommends upgrading to the latest Python before installing the nltk
module, so naturally I downloaded 2.7.1 (not going to 3.x), which also
comes with the <span class="caps">IDLE</span> app. I then installed PyYAML and nltk as the
instructions say.  In the folder with the <span class="caps">IDLE</span> app is a handy script to
update your .bash_profile, which I&nbsp;ran.</p>
<p>Python 2.7 would run in Terminal, but <code>import nltk</code> would not work
either in Terminal or <span class="caps">IDLE</span>.  Despite editing $<span class="caps">PATH</span> and my .bash_profile
as suggested on various websites, I couldn&#8217;t get nltk to install its
files on this new version of Python.  The nltk website suggests: <code>cd
/tmp/nltk-installer</code> and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> but
this didn&#8217;t fix it for me (seems like this would just run the installer&nbsp;again?).</p>
<p>After lots of head-scratching over how environment variables work and
running the nltk installer many times, I realised all I needed to do
was, in the Finder, copy the files nltk installer had placed at
/Library/Python/site-packages/2.6/ to the location of the 2.7 install at&nbsp;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/</p>
<p>After this <code>import nltk</code> worked immediately and
rage levels subsided noticeably.  Highly recommended.&nbsp; </p></div>

            <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog will be about the treatment of books in several senses, though
none of them quite as Myles na gCopaleen proposed. Partly it will
document my own learning around certain digital humanities projects I am
involved in, mainly to do with the steep learning curve that presents
itself in coming to grips with <span class="caps">XML</span>, <span class="caps">XSLT</span>, and digital publishing in
general.  But it will also be about physical books, reading, teaching
and the acquisitive nature that leads to having more books than I ever
get around to reading. Perhaps some thoughts on the teaching and other
work I will be doing this coming semester may appear, who knows? Given
the very hazy plans at this stage, I think it&#8217;s best that Myles has the
last&nbsp;word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">DOG</span> <span class="caps">EARS</span> <span class="caps">FOUR</span>-A-<span class="caps">PENNY</span>
Let me explain exactly what I mean. The wares in a bookshop look
completely unread. On the other hand, a school-boy&#8217;s Latin dictionary
looks read to the point of tatters. You know that the dictionary has
been opened and scanned perhaps a million times, and if you did not know
that there was such a thing as a box on the ear, you would conclude that
the boy is crazy about Latin and cannot bear to be away from his
dictionary. Similarly with our non-brow who wants his friends to infer
from a glancing around his house that he is a high-brow. He buys an
enormous book on the Russian ballet, written possibly in the language of
that distant but beautiful land. Our problem is to alter the book in a
reasonably short time so that anybody looking at it will conclude that
its owner has practically lived, supped and slept with it for many
months. You can, if you like, talk about designing a machine driven by a
small but efficient petrol motor that would &#8216;read&#8217; any book in five
minutes, the equivalent of five years or ten years&#8217; &#8216;reading&#8217; being
obtained by merely turning a knob. This, how-ever, is the cheap soulless
approach of the times we live in. No machine can do the same work as the
soft human fingers. The trained and ex-perienced book-handler is the
only real solution of this contemporary social problem. What does he do?
How does he work? What would he charge? How many types of handling would
there&nbsp;be?</p>
<p>These questions and many - I will answer the day after&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
