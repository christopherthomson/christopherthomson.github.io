Building, Mapping, Connecting</em> at <span class="caps">ANU</span>.  It describes a project I&#8217;m
currently working on in my spare time, the digitisation of Bridget
Underhill&#8217;s 1998 <em>Bibliography of Writing by Māori in English with
partial annotation</em>.  The poster covers the workflow for creating and
managing the digital resource plus an introduction of sorts to the
question of why it is important to make it available to a wider audience
than currently use it in its static / print form.  I&#8217;m publishing the
introduction below, and the whole poster can be viewed here: [Digitising
a Bibliography of Writing by Māori in English]&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to thank Dr Bridget Underhill for agreeing to develop the
project with me, <a href="https://twitter.com/joewiz">Joe Wicentowski</a> for his help with web development using eXist, and the <a href="http://aa-dh.org">Australasian Association for Digital Humanities</a> for providing me with a travel bursary to present my work at <span class="caps">DHA2012</span> - see what&#8217;s happening on Twitter by&nbsp;following #dha2012</p>
<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The attempt to produce a bibliography of all writing by Māori in the
English language over a period of more than a hundred years is an
incredibly ambitious task.  Bridget Underhill’s 1998 doctoral thesis
achieves nothing less,&nbsp;seeking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to collect and annotate writing by Māori in English from the
   earliest documents to the time of compilation, which terminated in
   September 1998. It includes Māori writers in English, Māori
   translators of Māori texts, largely occurring in the period before
   1870, and Māori writers transcribing, translating or in the
   original. Texts represented include fiction, prose, drama,
   nonfiction, medical reports, geographical accounts and oral
   accounts. The bibliography attempts to represent writing from all
   iwi of Aotearoa&nbsp;[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Underhill acknowledges the scale of the project and the challenges
it posed, she situates it broadly within a task of comparable
complexity: that of anthologists, historians and literary critics of the
1980s and 1990s who have sought to address the historical invisibility
of Māori writing in English. Witi Ihimaera, for instance, is well known
as the ‘first’ Māori novelist and one whose work is marked by
significant revision following the development of Māori radical politics
in the 1970s. His edited anthology <em>Into the World of Light</em> (1982)
attempted to address this invisibility but ten years later, around the
time Underhill began her project, he still acknowledged that “although
individual writers are known, writing by Māori still remains ‘hidden’ in
this country, either unknown or unpublished”[2].  Whether Māori writing
should more visible and by what means this should happen is still an
essential question for New Zealand’s literary and political&nbsp;culture.</p>
<p>Underhill’s bibliography includes entries for about 1300 Māori writers,
the majority of whom are not widely published or recognised in a
canonical sense, just as one would expect for a list of this size. There
are clearly many benefits to digitizing such a bibliography, not least
that it will make Underhill’s work using offline tools – writing
letters, making telephone calls – much more readily available to
researchers.  A digital bibliography can be updated; it can be corrected
and maintained effectively; and in its online form it can help introduce
hitherto little-known Māori writers to a wider readership.  As a means
of organising and presenting data about a literary culture, it could
make available a more complete picture of patterns in Māori writing and
publishing in English than has previously been possible.  Digital
researchers may bring the lens of what Franco Moretti calls ‘distant
reading’ to bear on these patterns, or enlist visualisation techniques
to present them.  The practical considerations obvious to digital
humanists are, therefore, broadly aligned with the project of making
Māori writing visible that has been underway for perhaps 30 years now. 
However, Underhill is quick to acknowledge the complexity of this
endeavor within New Zealand’s postcolonial context, and the importance
of Māori ownership of this&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Scholars have recognised the bibliography as a storehouse of evidence
that helps us examine the cultural history of Māori writing in English
from other points of view.  Patrick Evans, for instance, describes an
ideology of biculturalism in New Zealand, an assertion of cultural
parity between Māori and Pakeha evident in the iconography and literary
narratives of the mid-twentieth century, that has tended to produce
either an aestheticised, politically naïve art in the vein of Ihimaera’s
early work, or a more radical form of writing that is in large part
deliberately or strategically invisible to Pakeha culture.  As a close
reader, Evans points to the effects of this dominant ideology in the
Māori Affairs department publication <em>Te Ao Hou</em> (1952-75) and in the
early works and later revisionism of Ihimaera, but he suggests that it
can be evidenced more thoroughly and perhaps more subtly by an
examination of narrative patterns in the many little-known works found
in Underhill’s&nbsp;bibliography.</p>
<p>Turning to the many ‘unknown’ writers Underhill has documented, Evans
suggests, offers up figures such as Rowley Habib, who are invisible to
the degree that they  “[resist] the lure of the bicultural and its
inducements to write in the tropes which the dominant culture prescribes
for ‘Maori writing’”[3].  While there are more widely published Māori
authors working in a resistant mode, independent of “Pakeha-style
biculturalism”, the task of reading these subversive or alternative
threads relies on continuously updating what we know of both the
literary tradition and its offshoots and anti-traditions. Evans points
to the case of Alistair Campbell, a writer who “has had nowhere
comfortable to ‘fit’ in existing narratives of New Zealand
literature”[4] and who was in fact excluded from Underhill’s
bibliography; yet, by other more critically post-colonialist accounts of
Māori literary history, writing such as Campbell’s is very useful when
reading Māori writing against the grain of Pakeha versions of&nbsp;biculturalism.</p>
<p>In this context, a digital bibliography of Māori writing in English is
an opportunity to re-emphasise the value of heterogeneity in our
accounts of New Zealand’s literary history.  Although begun within an
academic institution and the print medium, an online version of this
valuable bibliography may enable new conversations about the history and
future of Māori writing through its exposure to the digital crowd. 
Rather than speculate on the form such conversations may take, perhaps
the most ‘<span class="caps">DH</span>’ aspect of the project is simply my wish to help make
Underhill’s data more widely available and see what people will do with&nbsp;it.</p>

            </h2>
            <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;d hoped to digest the summer school in a blog-as-you-go manner, but
each day was packed full of so much fantastic <span class="caps">DH</span> fare that I quickly
gave up on that plan.  But here&#8217;s my somewhat more considered review of
the first day, looking at most of the sessions I attended but
particularly the ones that are relevant to work I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>I went to four sessions on&nbsp;Monday:</p>
<p>(1) Creating digital texts using the <span class="caps">TEI</span> (part&nbsp;1)</p>
<p>The first session was something of a gallop through some <span class="caps">TEI</span> basics,
with Sebastian covering the initial material on what a <span class="caps">TEI</span> document
looks like, how to achieve well-formedness and validation, before moving
quickly on to more complex&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a fairly brief practical session to familiarise
ourselves with oXygen and some markup basics, we returned to hear
James&#8217;s talk on schema customisation using Roma.  He alternated between
a walkthrough of Roma and explaining the <span class="caps">ODD</span> (One Document Does it All)
<span class="caps">XML</span> that actually defines the custom schema.  I haven&#8217;t used <span class="caps">ODD</span> much
and would actually like to work on building a schema at the nuts and
bolts level, though I expect using Roma to get started would be the most
effective way to&nbsp;learn.</p>
<p>(2) &#8221;&#8230;and now what?&#8221;: Some approaches to project&nbsp;modelling</p>
<p>This presentation was delivered by Pip Willcox of the Bodleian Library,
and looked at some general principles of digital project management as
well as some fascinating details of some of the major projects she has
worked on.  The Shakespeare Quartos Archive was particularly interesting
because it involved international collaboration by (I think) six major
libraries and its fairly ambitious goals were achieved within a&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>Her main advice for <span class="caps">DH</span> projects was around communication and clear
documentation of each project, and with the kind of funding and
collaborative model that is the norm in <span class="caps">DH</span>, this was a very relevant&nbsp;message.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="caps">RDF</span> Modelling and&nbsp;Conversion</p>
<p>This session was somewhat outside of my experience, having only a vague
idea of what <span class="caps">RDF</span> does and never having used it.  Hmm.  Must look into
this some&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>(4) Plenary: Providing documents on the web: experience from&nbsp;legislation.gov.uk</p>
<p>Jeni Tennison is a well known <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">XSLT</span> expert, and she has clearly
tackled a major project as the architect of legislation.gov.uk.  The
website provides highly detailed, versioned records of <span class="caps">UK</span> legislation,
so provides not only the original form of any given piece of
legislation, it&#8217;s current form, but also every step in between.  Their
data comes in a variety of forms and can involve difficult substitutions
where changes cross or overlap document structures, or where changes are
made to a law that apply differently in England and&nbsp;Scotland.</p>
<p>Of interest to me is that they&#8217;re using a native <span class="caps">XML</span> database to handle
the data (I don&#8217;t think she mentioned which one).  This has proved more
flexible than a <span class="caps">SQL</span> database and is easily&nbsp;extensible.</p>
<p>They have also worked on user and re-user experience a lot, and are
moving to a participation phase where they get some major users to
contribute to the updating of the website.  There is an increasing
backlog of updates to the website, so they Since this is an open
project, those who would otherwise pay private legal services firms for
this information are motivated to help make it&nbsp;work.</p></div>

            </h2>
            <div class="entry-content"><p><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> (2/6/14): The right way to do this is to ignore this post and go get <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" title="virtualenv">virtualenv</a>.</p>
<p>Having spent a frustrating couple of hours on trying to set up the
Python <span class="caps">IDLE</span> and nltk module so I can teach myself some text mining
basics, I thought it would be worth noting the problems I had and how I
solved them.  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nltk-users/browse_thread/thread/e14b647243ca5b66" title="this thread">This thread</a> charts similar problems to mine, but I
resolved mine in a different way to the suggestions given. Basically,
the issue stems from installing a new version of Python alongside the
one that came with your&nbsp;Mac.</p>
<p>Instructions for setting up <a href="http://www.nltk.org/download">nltk</a> can be found at. Macs ship with Python installed, but the
<span class="caps">IDLE</span> app either does not come with <span class="caps">OSX</span> or is not enabled.  nltk.org
recommends upgrading to the latest Python before installing the nltk
module, so naturally I downloaded 2.7.1 (not going to 3.x), which also
comes with the <span class="caps">IDLE</span> app. I then installed PyYAML and nltk as the
instructions say.  In the folder with the <span class="caps">IDLE</span> app is a handy script to
update your .bash_profile, which I&nbsp;ran.</p>
<p>Python 2.7 would run in Terminal, but <code>import nltk</code> would not work
either in Terminal or <span class="caps">IDLE</span>.  Despite editing $<span class="caps">PATH</span> and my .bash_profile
as suggested on various websites, I couldn&#8217;t get nltk to install its
files on this new version of Python.  The nltk website suggests: <code>cd
/tmp/nltk-installer</code> and then <code>sudo python setup.py install</code> but
this didn&#8217;t fix it for me (seems like this would just run the installer&nbsp;again?).</p>
<p>After lots of head-scratching over how environment variables work and
running the nltk installer many times, I realised all I needed to do
was, in the Finder, copy the files nltk installer had placed at
/Library/Python/site-packages/2.6/ to the location of the 2.7 install at&nbsp;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/</p>
<p>After this <code>import nltk</code> worked immediately and
rage levels subsided noticeably.  Highly recommended.&nbsp; </p></div>
