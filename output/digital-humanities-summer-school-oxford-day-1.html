        <p>I&#8217;d hoped to digest the summer school in a blog-as-you-go manner, but
each day was packed full of so much fantastic <span class="caps">DH</span> fare that I quickly
gave up on that plan.  But here&#8217;s my somewhat more considered review of
the first day, looking at most of the sessions I attended but
particularly the ones that are relevant to work I&#8217;ve been&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>I went to four sessions on&nbsp;Monday:</p>
<p>(1) Creating digital texts using the <span class="caps">TEI</span> (part&nbsp;1)</p>
<p>The first session was something of a gallop through some <span class="caps">TEI</span> basics,
with Sebastian covering the initial material on what a <span class="caps">TEI</span> document
looks like, how to achieve well-formedness and validation, before moving
quickly on to more complex&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a fairly brief practical session to familiarise
ourselves with oXygen and some markup basics, we returned to hear
James&#8217;s talk on schema customisation using Roma.  He alternated between
a walkthrough of Roma and explaining the <span class="caps">ODD</span> (One Document Does it All)
<span class="caps">XML</span> that actually defines the custom schema.  I haven&#8217;t used <span class="caps">ODD</span> much
and would actually like to work on building a schema at the nuts and
bolts level, though I expect using Roma to get started would be the most
effective way to&nbsp;learn.</p>
<p>(2) &#8221;&#8230;and now what?&#8221;: Some approaches to project&nbsp;modelling</p>
<p>This presentation was delivered by Pip Willcox of the Bodleian Library,
and looked at some general principles of digital project management as
well as some fascinating details of some of the major projects she has
worked on.  The Shakespeare Quartos Archive was particularly interesting
because it involved international collaboration by (I think) six major
libraries and its fairly ambitious goals were achieved within a&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>Her main advice for <span class="caps">DH</span> projects was around communication and clear
documentation of each project, and with the kind of funding and
collaborative model that is the norm in <span class="caps">DH</span>, this was a very relevant&nbsp;message.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="caps">RDF</span> Modelling and&nbsp;Conversion</p>
<p>This session was somewhat outside of my experience, having only a vague
idea of what <span class="caps">RDF</span> does and never having used it.  Hmm.  Must look into
this some&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>(4) Plenary: Providing documents on the web: experience from&nbsp;legislation.gov.uk</p>
<p>Jeni Tennison is a well known <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">XSLT</span> expert, and she has clearly
tackled a major project as the architect of legislation.gov.uk.  The
website provides highly detailed, versioned records of <span class="caps">UK</span> legislation,
so provides not only the original form of any given piece of
legislation, it&#8217;s current form, but also every step in between.  Their
data comes in a variety of forms and can involve difficult substitutions
where changes cross or overlap document structures, or where changes are
made to a law that apply differently in England and&nbsp;Scotland.</p>
<p>Of interest to me is that they&#8217;re using a native <span class="caps">XML</span> database to handle
the data (I don&#8217;t think she mentioned which one).  This has proved more
flexible than a <span class="caps">SQL</span> database and is easily&nbsp;extensible.</p>
<p>They have also worked on user and re-user experience a lot, and are
moving to a participation phase where they get some major users to
contribute to the updating of the website.  There is an increasing
backlog of updates to the website, so they Since this is an open
project, those who would otherwise pay private legal services firms for
this information are motivated to help make it&nbsp;work.</p>
