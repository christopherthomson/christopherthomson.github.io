        <p>Last Friday I had the privilege to coordinate one of the <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/" title="National Digital Forum">National
Digital Forum</a>&#8216;s regional <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/regions/" title="barcamps">barcamps</a>. These events are aimed at
increasing connections and participation amongst people active in
digital culture and heritage in New Zealand, and ours brought together
more than thirty librarians, archivists, art gallery / curator folks and
a variety of others for a morning of diverse and interesting debate. We
also had a great special guest, Michael Lascarides of the National
Library of New Zealand, who outlined a few elements of his philosophy on
doing work in the digital world with particular reference to interaction
design and&nbsp;crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>As the event organiser, I was often on the periphery of the breakout
group discussions, but I got to hear some wonderful fragments. The
session topics ranged from familiar information management issues, such
as &#8220;Making Linked Open Data Easier&#8221; and &#8220;Archiving &#8216;copyright unknown&#8217;
material&#8221;, to the tech cutting edge in &#8220;Google Glass <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Society&#8221;, to the
wide-ranging and philosophically challenging back-and-forth in &#8220;Piracy
as a Force for Good&#8221;. It was great to see that our participants were
quite vocal and keen to debate some complex issues. In fact, I struggled
to break up some groups as each session drew to a&nbsp;close!</p>
<p>The value of these barcamps is that they help break down barriers
between people working on similar projects and problems in different
institutions. I&#8217;ve been to a couple of &#8216;unconferences&#8217; now, and it has
been my experience that it can be very satisfying to discuss these sorts
of things outside of the usual framework of the conference presentation,
where we tend to show just the best or most &#8216;original&#8217; aspects of work
we&#8217;ve done, rather than compare notes on a lot of the common issues and
challenges we are all interested in. The barcamp format also makes it
easier to talk about things you have only just begun learning or only
recently discovered as it doesn&#8217;t require anyone to be an expert.  It
can be hard to have these sorts of conversations outside your own
limited sphere, so I hope we can find ways to hold more of this type of
event in&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Notes from some of the sessions have been collated <a href="http://bit.ly/13x0npI" title="here">here</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all who participated for making it such a lively and
rewarding&nbsp;morning.</p>
