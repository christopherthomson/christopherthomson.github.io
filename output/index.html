            </h2>
            <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday I had the privilege to coordinate one of the <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/" title="National Digital Forum">National
Digital Forum</a>&#8216;s regional <a href="http://www.ndf.org.nz/regions/" title="barcamps">barcamps</a>. These events are aimed at
increasing connections and participation amongst people active in
digital culture and heritage in New Zealand, and ours brought together
more than thirty librarians, archivists, art gallery / curator folks and
a variety of others for a morning of diverse and interesting debate. We
also had a great special guest, Michael Lascarides of the National
Library of New Zealand, who outlined a few elements of his philosophy on
doing work in the digital world with particular reference to interaction
design and&nbsp;crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>As the event organiser, I was often on the periphery of the breakout
group discussions, but I got to hear some wonderful fragments. The
session topics ranged from familiar information management issues, such
as &#8220;Making Linked Open Data Easier&#8221; and &#8220;Archiving &#8216;copyright unknown&#8217;
material&#8221;, to the tech cutting edge in &#8220;Google Glass <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Society&#8221;, to the
wide-ranging and philosophically challenging back-and-forth in &#8220;Piracy
as a Force for Good&#8221;. It was great to see that our participants were
quite vocal and keen to debate some complex issues. In fact, I struggled
to break up some groups as each session drew to a&nbsp;close!</p>
<p>The value of these barcamps is that they help break down barriers
between people working on similar projects and problems in different
institutions. I&#8217;ve been to a couple of &#8216;unconferences&#8217; now, and it has
been my experience that it can be very satisfying to discuss these sorts
of things outside of the usual framework of the conference presentation,
where we tend to show just the best or most &#8216;original&#8217; aspects of work
we&#8217;ve done, rather than compare notes on a lot of the common issues and
challenges we are all interested in. The barcamp format also makes it
easier to talk about things you have only just begun learning or only
recently discovered as it doesn&#8217;t require anyone to be an expert.  It
can be hard to have these sorts of conversations outside your own
limited sphere, so I hope we can find ways to hold more of this type of
event in&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Notes from some of the sessions have been collated <a href="http://bit.ly/13x0npI" title="here">here</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all who participated for making it such a lively and
rewarding&nbsp;morning.</p></div>

straightforward that an example isn&#8217;t&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>I wanted a list of results for each author in the bibliography, broken
down according to content provider offering those results. This can be
grabbed by specifying <code>facets=content\_partner</code> in the query string.  All
the work is done by the XQuery doc() function in the third line below -
everything else is&nbsp;presentation.</p>

            </h2>
            <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working on converting a large bibliography&nbsp;from Microsoft Word docx
format to <span class="caps">TEI</span>. &nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://christopherthomson.co.nz/blog/?p=68">A few months ago</a> I was pretty certain I&#8217;d be
approaching this with a manual process, mostly because of the difficulty
of constructing divs for each type of bibliography entry and other
structured sections. But Word styles and <a class="reference external" href="http://oxgarage.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8080/ege-webclient/">OxGarage</a> makes it possible
to convert from docx to <span class="caps">TEI</span> with enough structure that most of the
difficulties I saw then can be&nbsp;overcome.</p>
<p>Luckily, the original document had an index of authors which marked the
start of each entry, and styles had been applied fairly consistently to
distinguish headings, annotations and citations. Here&#8217;s an example of
the structure of the entry I wanted to&nbsp;isolate:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">[gist]http://gist.github.com/3606192[/gist]</span></tt></p>
<p>The problem is that there&#8217;s no tag to define where this entry ends - it
just lists another paragraph containing an author name and so on. The
first step needed was to go from an &#8216;anchor&#8217; marking the start - in this
case I used the index element - to a complete <span class="caps">XML</span> element wrapping each
author&#8217;s entry.&nbsp; Google turned up <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6865667/xpath-flat-hierarchy-and-stop-condition">a rather complex piece of XQuery</a> to
solve the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>This required very little adjustment to get the result I was after. I
just changed the selection of the $childs and tweaked the formula used
within the element constructor to ensure the first paragraph was&nbsp;included.</p>
<p>The next step was to split the file into a collection of separate files,
one for each entry. &nbsp;Again, the work has been <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery/Splitting_Files">done and documented</a>.</p>
<p>This worked well with only a couple of small changes to the element
constructor from the example given: 1) I added the suggested $count to
generate a numbered filename, and 2) I needed to remove some stray
whitespace in the element I used for the entry name, using
fn:normalize-space(text()). I ran the query in the browser rather than
in oXygen 12.2, as I couldn&#8217;t get oXygen to recognise the xmldb
namespace needed for this code (this seems to be because oXygen was
using Saxon rather than eXist to parse the XQuery, despite the
Preferences saying it should use eXist). The element constructor to be
returned looked like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>[gist]https://gist.github.com/3606928[/gist]</p>
<p>The next step will be creating some more structure with div and
biblStruct elements, and then I&#8217;ll need to pull apart the citations&nbsp;themselves.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The attempt to produce a bibliography of all writing by Māori in the
English language over a period of more than a hundred years is an
incredibly ambitious task.  Bridget Underhill’s 1998 doctoral thesis
achieves nothing less,&nbsp;seeking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to collect and annotate writing by Māori in English from the
   earliest documents to the time of compilation, which terminated in
   September 1998. It includes Māori writers in English, Māori
   translators of Māori texts, largely occurring in the period before
   1870, and Māori writers transcribing, translating or in the
   original. Texts represented include fiction, prose, drama,
   nonfiction, medical reports, geographical accounts and oral
   accounts. The bibliography attempts to represent writing from all
   iwi of Aotearoa&nbsp;[1].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Underhill acknowledges the scale of the project and the challenges
it posed, she situates it broadly within a task of comparable
complexity: that of anthologists, historians and literary critics of the
1980s and 1990s who have sought to address the historical invisibility
of Māori writing in English. Witi Ihimaera, for instance, is well known
as the ‘first’ Māori novelist and one whose work is marked by
significant revision following the development of Māori radical politics
in the 1970s. His edited anthology <em>Into the World of Light</em> (1982)
attempted to address this invisibility but ten years later, around the
time Underhill began her project, he still acknowledged that “although
individual writers are known, writing by Māori still remains ‘hidden’ in
this country, either unknown or unpublished”[2].  Whether Māori writing
should more visible and by what means this should happen is still an
essential question for New Zealand’s literary and political&nbsp;culture.</p>
<p>Underhill’s bibliography includes entries for about 1300 Māori writers,
the majority of whom are not widely published or recognised in a
canonical sense, just as one would expect for a list of this size. There
are clearly many benefits to digitizing such a bibliography, not least
that it will make Underhill’s work using offline tools – writing
letters, making telephone calls – much more readily available to
researchers.  A digital bibliography can be updated; it can be corrected
and maintained effectively; and in its online form it can help introduce
hitherto little-known Māori writers to a wider readership.  As a means
of organising and presenting data about a literary culture, it could
make available a more complete picture of patterns in Māori writing and
publishing in English than has previously been possible.  Digital
researchers may bring the lens of what Franco Moretti calls ‘distant
reading’ to bear on these patterns, or enlist visualisation techniques
to present them.  The practical considerations obvious to digital
humanists are, therefore, broadly aligned with the project of making
Māori writing visible that has been underway for perhaps 30 years now. 
However, Underhill is quick to acknowledge the complexity of this
endeavor within New Zealand’s postcolonial context, and the importance
of Māori ownership of this&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>Scholars have recognised the bibliography as a storehouse of evidence
that helps us examine the cultural history of Māori writing in English
from other points of view.  Patrick Evans, for instance, describes an
ideology of biculturalism in New Zealand, an assertion of cultural
parity between Māori and Pakeha evident in the iconography and literary
narratives of the mid-twentieth century, that has tended to produce
either an aestheticised, politically naïve art in the vein of Ihimaera’s
early work, or a more radical form of writing that is in large part
deliberately or strategically invisible to Pakeha culture.  As a close
reader, Evans points to the effects of this dominant ideology in the
Māori Affairs department publication <em>Te Ao Hou</em> (1952-75) and in the
early works and later revisionism of Ihimaera, but he suggests that it
can be evidenced more thoroughly and perhaps more subtly by an
examination of narrative patterns in the many little-known works found
in Underhill’s&nbsp;bibliography.</p>
<p>Turning to the many ‘unknown’ writers Underhill has documented, Evans
suggests, offers up figures such as Rowley Habib, who are invisible to
the degree that they  “[resist] the lure of the bicultural and its
inducements to write in the tropes which the dominant culture prescribes
for ‘Maori writing’”[3].  While there are more widely published Māori
authors working in a resistant mode, independent of “Pakeha-style
biculturalism”, the task of reading these subversive or alternative
threads relies on continuously updating what we know of both the
literary tradition and its offshoots and anti-traditions. Evans points
to the case of Alistair Campbell, a writer who “has had nowhere
comfortable to ‘fit’ in existing narratives of New Zealand
literature”[4] and who was in fact excluded from Underhill’s
bibliography; yet, by other more critically post-colonialist accounts of
Māori literary history, writing such as Campbell’s is very useful when
reading Māori writing against the grain of Pakeha versions of&nbsp;biculturalism.</p>
<p>In this context, a digital bibliography of Māori writing in English is
an opportunity to re-emphasise the value of heterogeneity in our
accounts of New Zealand’s literary history.  Although begun within an
academic institution and the print medium, an online version of this
valuable bibliography may enable new conversations about the history and
future of Māori writing through its exposure to the digital crowd. 
Rather than speculate on the form such conversations may take, perhaps
the most ‘<span class="caps">DH</span>’ aspect of the project is simply my wish to help make
Underhill’s data more widely available and see what people will do with&nbsp;it.</p>
